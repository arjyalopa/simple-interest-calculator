# Simple Interest Calculator

## Description
This project demonstrates a simple interest calculator that calculates interest based on principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula
Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## Example
If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
